# Diagnostics

The worst library for Stackdriver logging and tracing:

- Not the fastest
- Not the most feature rich
- Not optimised for performance
- Just plain simple

Diagnostics is a plain boring, simple, easy to read and understand Go module for Stackdriver logging and tracing mainly written for my own personal use in projects which are not Netflix and can afford 1 extra millisecond to write a log.
